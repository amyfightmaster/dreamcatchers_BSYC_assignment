    <h1>What Is Handmade by Peg?</h1>
    <main><p>For this assignment, where we could build anything of our choice, I wanted to practice using HTML and CSS.  I also wanted to talk about something very important to me--that is, Handmade by Peg, my Mom's small crafting business.</p>
        <p>Handmade by Peg was started several years ago, when Mom and I were going through a bit of a rough patch.  We were both going to crafting classes at the local library for something to do, a chance to get out of the house.  One of those crafting classes involved making dreamcatchers.  Dreamcatchers are traditionally created by certain Native American groups, and take the form of a hoop wrapped with leather or fabric.  A web, symbolizing a spider, is then woven, leaving a small hole in the center of the web.  The web is believed to catch nightmares, with pleasant dreams escape through the small hole, trickling onto the sleeper by feathers attached to the bottom of the dreamcatcher. My mom discovered that she really loved the process of making dreamcatchers.  So she began making them.  Soon, she set up a booth at a craft fair at the local library.  After that, she set up booths at local craft fairs and even got a place in a farmer's market for the past two summers.</p>
        <p>While Mom started with dreamcatchers, those aren't the product that she makes these days.  In time, Handmade by Peg's product line began to diversify as Mom discovered new techniques.  For example, she learned how to make different styles of paracord bracelets, macram√© items like pot-hangers, woven pot-holders--which are not made with synthetic fabrics--and tie-dyed T-shirts.  One thing that has not changed, however, is the time and care put into making each piece.  Everything is unique, and everything really is handmade by Peg.</p></main>
